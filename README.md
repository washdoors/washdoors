 ## Algorithm
   - let x be the position  of rider
   - let y be the position of customer
   - let z be the position of shop

   - D (x, y) be the ditance between rider and cutomer
   - D (y, z) be the ditance between shop and cutomer
   - D (x, z) be the ditance between rider and shop

   - Find the rider and shop for customer
      - plot the graph with position of shop customer and rider in that area
      - find the shortest path for customer (taking as origin) to shop. (Here shop selection is done)
      - find the shortest path from customer and shop (taking first origin customer and second origin shop) to rider (Here rider selection is done)
      - send the notification to rider.
